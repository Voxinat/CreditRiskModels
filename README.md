# CreditRiskModels
Implements some structural models for credit risk measures

In particular, it is the reference code for the paper "A structural approach to default modelling with pure jump processes" (Aguilar, Pesci & James 2021) 

It implements negGamma, negIG and Variance Gamma models to estimate default probabilities of the issuers from the dataset "Data issuers"

The code is not meant to be super clean but is enough to understand the underlying machinery of each model
